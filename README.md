# UUID1c18582a-a38f-11ec-b909-0242ac120002

Requirement:

This is implementation of the following assignment:

Develop a function that takes one string input of any number of integers separated by single whitespace. The function then outputs the longest increasing subsequence (increased by any number) present in that sequence. If more than 1 sequence exists with the longest length, output the earliest one. 

Technology:

C# and .Net Framework 5.0

Source code structure:

A solution named “UUID” has been created, with the following 3 projects:

1. UUIDTest - It contains Unit Test cases.

2. UUIDContract - It contains interface of the logic to find longest increasing subsequence.

3. UUIDImplementtion - It contains actual implementation of the logic.

Naming convention:

The word “UUID” has been used as name of this assignment. The word doesn’t have any special meaning. The assignment had advised to use a UUID as repository name. I used the word UUID literally, for naming the solution. (However the repository name is a valid UUID i.e. a universally unique identifier, as advised).

Github Action:

A Github Action has been created to build and test the solution on every pull and push. Please navigate to "Actions" tab for viewing the yml file of the action and also for checking the previous runs.
